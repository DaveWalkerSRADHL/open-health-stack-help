# What is  Open Health Stack?

Today’s health studies using wearable devices typically consist of a wearable device to sense input data, a mobile app that tracks the data, and additional tools to store and analyze the data. Developing these studies from scratch is costly and time consuming. Clearly, a common-use framework can lessen the burden for everyone.

Open Health Stack is an open-source project that provides end-to-end solutions for collecting and analyzing data from wearable devices. Applications include medical research studies to clinician services to whatever your imagination envisions. And as open-source project, you are invited to contribute those visions to grow the project.

The stack includes:

-   A software development kit (SDK) for app development
-   A web portal for survey creation, participant management, and data analysis
-   Backend services and a data engine available through application programming interface (API) endpoints

## The App SDK

The app SDK provides developers with what’s needed to create mobile apps that collect data from participants. You create a mobile app that solicits survey responses from the participant, receives data from the wearable device, displays information to the participant, and transmits the data to the portal for further analysis. Building blocks cover:

- Participant onboarding and consent
- Survey presentation
- Participant task creation
- Visual reporting to keep participants engaged
- Data management and transmission to the portal

## The Web Portal

The web portal is a customizable dashboard for interactive data visualization. Managers of the studies use the portal to:

- Create surveys
- Manage participants
- Analyze participant data

# Recommended Workflow
1.  Set up your environment.
2.  Set up a study.
3.  Create an app to track your study.
4.  Create a survey to track your study.
5.  Register participants.
6.  Run your study.
7.  Analyze the results.
